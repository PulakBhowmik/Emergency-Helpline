## What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

<p>getElementById("id") -> returns a single element (the first and only with that id).
<br>getElementsByClassName("className") returns a live HTMLCollection of all elements with that class.
<br>querySelector("CSS selector") returns the first element matching the given CSS selector.
<br>querySelectorAll("CSS selector") returns a static NodeList of all elements matching the selector. We use it when we want all matches using advanced CSS selectors.
